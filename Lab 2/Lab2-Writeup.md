# An Interactive Map of Ski Runs at Cypress Mountain Resort

## Reflective Analysis
Although ski resorts provide very detailed and artistic maps of the mountain and their ski runs, I thought it would be interesting to put a twist on this common practice by providing some interactivity to these types of maps. 

The processes used to produce the map were somewhat similar to the interactive UBC maps produced earlier this semester. First, the ski runs themselves were not available online, so I decided to create them on www.geojson.io, which allowed for further customization such as adding names to each line and difficulty ratings. In North America, ski resorts typically use the following colour scheme:

Easy - Green
Moderate - Blue
Hard - Black Diamond
Expert - Double Black Diamond

However, I thought it would be more intuitive to the viewer if the colour grade was instead green, blue, red, and black, going from easiest to hardest. 

A button that allows the viewer to see all the ski runs is used to provide a general overview of what Cypress Resort has to offer. More importantly, a search button allows the viewer to see the runs categorized by difficulty, which is useful in allowing the user to cater the map to their skiing/snowboarding ability. A background map with contour lines was used to provide depth in terms of elevation. 

## What's Next?
Although the map contains some useful interactivity, there are many ways that it can be built upon and elevated to the next level. For example, being able to see one's current location on the map would be useful if this was implemented into an app and you were to use it on the mountain. Also, being able to add ski runs of multiple difficulties would add an increased amount of interactivity.
